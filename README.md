# Companionship Robot for People with Anxiety

This project implements facial emotion analysis using a Raspberry Pi, OpenCV, and a trained deep learning model. It captures video from a webcam, detects faces using Haar cascades, and classifies the detected faces into different emotions using a pre-trained model. Depending on the predicted emotion, the Raspberry Pi's motor control module is used to perform specific actions.
